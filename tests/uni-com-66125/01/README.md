# Aldi Home Protector Doorchime

This is made by uni-com http://www.uni-com.uk.com/ and has the model number 66125. 

The button module is powered by an AD1614AT chip (which is an OEM part number for an  SI4010 https://circuitmaker.com/Components/Details/CMP-2939e1126600f6fe-4 ). According to the datasheet the SI4010 chip has a 4 byte unique id, I'm expecting this to be transmitted to be the unique id for each doorbell button.

I have two of these devices, I have attached 2 capture files from each button. Each button appears to reliably return a repeating sequence of four bytes.
