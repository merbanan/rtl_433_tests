======================

I recorded creating the test files using a measuring tape and the sonic range finder.  The recoding shows the depth on a measuring tape, the receiver and the output of of rtl_433

I captured the data with the following command
rtl_433 -f 914600000 -a -t

The video has been uploaded here:

Here are the values and files they should be recorded in

30cm  009-016
40cm  020-032
50cm  036-052
60cm  056-069
70cm  073-087
80cm  093-107
90cm  113-127
100cm 133-164

I believe the existing code for the oil watchman is also decoding a temperature value.  The temperature at the time of the recording was around 71f
