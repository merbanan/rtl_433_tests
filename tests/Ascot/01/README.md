Ascot PO6335/R29
================
This Ascot Humidity/Temperature SN:PO6335 TYPE:R29 was bought from Aldi UK in 2008.

It's worked reliably since then.  I have been meaning to get around it to the rtl_433 list for some time, and recently, following a battery change, decided to grab the data.

There are 3 channels which don't appear to change the TX frequency, so I assume they instead change a bit pattern in the data.  I have included a sample from each 'channel' setting. Reported values may not be exact, as the device appears to update the display (and maybe readings?) when the TX button is pushed.

* Channel 1:	20.3 C,	65 %RH,	gfile01.data
* Channel 2:	21.6 C,	79 %RH,	gfile03.data
* Channel 3:	24.3 C,	81 %RH,	gfile05.data
* Channel 1:	23.6 C,	71 %RH,	gfile07.data
* Channel 1:	23.7 C,	67 %RH,	gfile08.data
* Channel 1:	23.5 C,	67 %RH,	gfile09.data

There is a recording of the baseband ASK audio from GQRX and an accopanying screen print of the RF Spectrum. There are also some pictures of my R29 type transmitter and the 60108 type receiver. Both look a bit battered.

I'm happy to do any other measurements that are required.
