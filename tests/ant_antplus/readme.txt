I captured ANT+ packets from two different hearth monitors devices, will soon check in the decoder codePlease note that, unlike most devices in the repository, ANT and ANT+ operate in ISM band between 2.4GHz and 2.5GHz. ANT+ devices are always on 2.457GHz. ANT and ANT+ devices require either a PlutoSDR, a device capable of tuning above 2.4GHz or, if using RTL-SDR, a downconverter.Also, since the signal itself is short bursts of 1Mbps data, GFSK encoded, sample rate should be 4Msps or higher. Can work with sample rates as low as 2Msps, but unreliably
