Honeywell CM921/BDR91 (Evohome)
===============================

The samples in this directory are messages exchanged between a
[Honeywell CM921](https://heatingcontrols.honeywellhome.com/products/Programmable-Thermostats/TPI/CM921/)
room thermostat and a
[Honeywell BDR91](https://heatingcontrols.honeywellhome.com/products/thermostats/wireless-relay-boxes/BDR91A1000-Wireless-Relay-Box/) relay box.
They use a (small) subset of the Evohome protocol.
