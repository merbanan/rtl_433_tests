The device sends motion events when detected, and does not support an all clear message.  When testing, battery level monitoring did not seem to be supported, but it did send a heartbeat roughly every 2 hours.  So when implementing a client, have a 2 hour watchdog for the heartbeat message, and if you don't receive it, say battery low or not responding.
