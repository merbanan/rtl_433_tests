Dish network receivers use IR, UHF, or IR/UHF remotes. The remote used to create
this driver was model "6.3", FCC id DKNFSK03. These signals were captured 
on or around 384 MHz - the FCC device test report claims there are 9 discrete
channels - 369.39, 371.02, 375.17, 376.83, 388.17, 391.40, 394.25, 395.76, and
possibly 383.25. 

The associated decoder is called dish_remote_6_3.
