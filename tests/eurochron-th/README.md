# Eurochron temperature and humidity sensor
## Modulation parameters
modulation = OOK_PULSE_PPM,

short_width = 1016,

long_width = 2024,

gap_limit = 2100,

reset_limit = 8200,
## Datagram format
Datagram length is always 36 bits per row. 
Each datagram will be repeated multiple times per transmission for checking data integrity.

    IIIIIIII B00P0000 HHHHHHHH TTTTTTTT TTTT
      
      - I: ID (new ID will be generated at battery change!)
      - B: Battery low
      - P: TX-Button pressed
      - H: Humidity (%)
      - T: Temperature (Â°C * 10)
      - 0: Unknown / always zero
## Device type recognition
Device type identification is only possible by datagram length and some zero bits. Therefore this device is disabled by default (as it could easily trigger false alarms).
## Update intervals
- transmission time slot every 12 seconds 
- at least once within 120 seconds (with stable values) 
- down to 12 seconds (with rapidly changing values)
