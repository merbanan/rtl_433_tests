# TX-141BV3 Data
It appears like this is not decoding correctly. Attached are several samples. Most of them float around ~70F (22C), although I put the sensor outside and the temperature decreased as follows:    
- g006: 68.2F / 20.1 C
- g007: 63.3 F / 17.4 C
- g008: 58.3 F / 14.6 C

I didn't record the temperature on the clock for the other samples.
The pulse width appears to be 33, like the other issue said

Also note that several of these samples (mostly the earlier ones) were taken with the "test" button. Not sure if this makes a difference, but 006, 007, and 008 were taken without the test button.
