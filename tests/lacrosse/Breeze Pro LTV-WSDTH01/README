I'll confess that I'm not much of a signals guy but I did manage to breakout
most of the protocol on this remote sensor.  There are four sample files
submitted.  Each captures one packet.  The corresponding sensor readings from
the LaCrosse 79400 console are provided in the readings.txt file.

The majority of the protocol is described in the protocol.txt file.  There are
only two bytes of data that I didn't take time to work on.  One byte containing
flags or status info and the other for the CRC byte.  It's quite possible that
the CRC is the same one used for the LaCrosse TX145wsdth (CRC-8 poly 0x31 init
0x00 over preceeding 7 bytes) since the circuit boards (according to photos on
file at FCC for these sensors) appear to be identical.  But I don't know how
to verify that.  MCU programming could be different but maybe that doesn't
matter if the HopeRF tx/rx chips have the ability to generate/check the CRC.

Specifics on sensor hardware are also provided in the protocol.txt file.

If I can supply additional sample files to help wrap this up please let me know
and I'll do what I can to oblige.
