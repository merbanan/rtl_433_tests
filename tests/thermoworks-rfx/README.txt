Readings were taken in Airspy SDR# with the gain turned all the way down. During this session the probe was removed from its dock and I held it tightly in my hand to warm it up and force temperature updates. The screenshot is from the Thermoworks app on my phone. The application did not have advanced mode turned on and it should display the lowest reading from the 4 sensors.
