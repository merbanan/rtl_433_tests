<h1>RT26 Wristband transmitter</h1> {868.3 MHz button to page caregiver}

> "The RT26 wristband transmitter has been specially adapted to the requirements of people in need of care. The large push button makes it easy to operate.
> Switching electrical devices on and off with a 1-button operation or activating paging systems are among the standard application areas of this transmitter.
> An LED indicates if the battery needs to be changed. If the battery is running low, a separate radio signal is transmitted which can be analyzed by a corresponding Easywave receiver."
