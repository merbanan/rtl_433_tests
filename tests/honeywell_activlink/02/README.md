## Honeywell "ActivLink" Wireless Chimes

North American variants of this device operate at 916.8 MHz FSK 50kHz deviation. Australian variants are also reported to use this same frequency.

European variants seem to operate at or near 868 MHz, thought I haven't personally tested
these systems.  However, their data frame seems to be the same format.

[There's some](https://livewell.honeywellhome.com/en/support/alarm-support/) [indication](https://livewell.honeywellhome.com/en/support/alarm-support/) that this protocol may be based on the Friedland / Response 868MHz alarm system.  [This FAQ](https://livewell.honeywellhome.com/en/support/doorbell-support/) 
indicates that the 868MHz variants of the Honeywell ActivLink system is compatible 
with the Friedland Libra+ Wirefree Doorbell system.  [An IQ sample from this system](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Friedland_Libra%2B_48249SL_wireless_doorbell) is available at the [Signal Identification Guide wiki](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/Signal_Identification_Guide) and should be analyzed further.

Data below applies to the 916.8 MHz systems I've tested and and signal submissions I've
been able to review.  If you'd like to get in touch with me to 
[submit data from your Honeywell device](https://goo.gl/forms/SuxA3qgVRivXmNMf1), I'd
like to hear from you.

Modulation rate seems to be 6250 baud, so each HIGH or LOW symbol is 160 μs.

Data bits are encoded over three symbols. A "0" bit is defined as HIGH-LOW-LOW,
and a "1" bit is defined as "HIGH-HIGH-LOW".

Each frame of data consists of a LOW-LOW-LOW signal preamble, 48 bits (144 
symbols) of data, and a postamble of HIGH-HIGH-HIGH.

The signal seems to be 50 consecutive repetitions of the frame, then symbols
LOW-LOW-LOW-HIGH-HIGH-HIGH, and finally 2 continuous milliseconds (2000 μs) of
LOW.

Each data frame is 48 bits, or 6 bytes long.  From experimentation and from
the signals I've collected so far, this seems to be how bits are being used.

### Data Frame Device ID Notes:
For simplicity, the full Device ID for the device might just be the first 
4 bytes.  Device Type should be included as part of the Device ID since if 
it is changed, a receiver would no longer recognize the signal as being from 
the same device.  Bits after byte 4 that seem to be part of the Key ID are
always 0 on all devices I've seen.

### Data Frame KEY UNKNOWN 0 Notes:
These bits are 0 in all devices I've seen.  Some preliminary tests with
generating artificial signals seems to indicate that if these bits are not
0, the receiver does not seem to recognize the signal as a previously
recognized device.  So, these bits are either part of the device ID, or they
simply must be 0 for the receiver to accept the signal as valid.  Further
testing here is required.

### Data Frame DEVICE TYPE Notes:
For all devices I've tested, it seems that only the two bits specified for this
field change depending on the type of device used to generate the signal.
It seems logical that perhaps the the width of this field is more than two
bits.  It might even be all of the 4th byte.  I have no data to confirm this, 
though.  For all devices I've seen, though, only these two bits of the 4th 
byte might be anything other than 0.

### Data Frame ALERT Notes:
On some receivers, such as the Honeywell RDWL917AX, an alert type of 01 or
10 forces the receiver to display a blinking right and left pattern, instead
of the normal full perimeter LED blinking.

### Data Frame RELAY Notes:
On some receiver models, such as the "Honeywell RDWL917AX", the base receiver 
will immediately retransmit a valid received signal if the RELAY bit is NOT 
set. The data in the retransmitted signal will be modified with the RELAY bit 
set. This seems to be an effort to extend a signal to more distant receivers.
