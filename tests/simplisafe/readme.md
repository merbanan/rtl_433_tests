Simplisafe Home Security sensors transmit using Pulse Interval
and Width Modulation (PIWM) on 433.92 MHz. Manufacturer website

Unlike most modulations the total duration of transmission
depends on the value of bits. The bits are encoded into distance
between edges (short pulse/gap represent 0, long pulse/gap represents 1).

Update: 5/16/2018:
Additional information related to the security advisory disclosure can be read at

The KeyPad transmissions require you to disable automatic gain in order for the SDR 
to receive the signal properly.

You'll note the KeyChain is indistinguishable from a normal sensor except when the
Alarm Off button is selected.
