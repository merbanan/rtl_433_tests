Simplisafe Home Security sensors transmit using Pulse Interval
and Width Modulation (PIWM) on 433.92 MHz. Manufacturer website

Unlike most modulations the total duration of transmission
depends on the value of bits. The bits are encoded into distance
between edges (short pulse/gap represent 0, long pulse/gap represents 1).
