Acurite manufactures various weather sensors that are compatible with the rtl_433 application:

    * VN1TXC - A '5-in-1' outdoor sensor that transmits data for wind speed, wind direction,
               temperature, humidity, and rain fall. Transmissions also include battery
               status and channel settings as well as a unique ID. The sensor transmits
               every 18 seconds with two types of transmissions: one contains data for wind
               speed, temperature, and humidity, the other for wind speed, wind direction, and
               rainfall
