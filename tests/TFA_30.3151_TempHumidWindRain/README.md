describing the captured signals:
  captured at 868.3M with Nooelec RTLSDR-USB Stick R820T with rtl_433-rtlsdr.exe under Windows 10
  (rtl_433-rtlsdr.exe -f 868.3M -S unknown)
  Sadly no Head Unit is available anymore. So  can't give the Temp/Humid values.
  I can only measure it in parallel with another Temp/Humid Sensor.

  The Signal comes from an TFA Stratos Radio Weather Station 35.1077

  Main Unit - TFA 30.3151 (with Temperature, Humidity and DCF77 Time)
    |- connected Wind Sensor - TFA 30.3153
    |- connected Rain Sensor - TFA 30.3152
