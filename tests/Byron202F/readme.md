These are the files related to the Byron BY202F Doorbell sold in the UK.
If anyone can please help add to rtl_433 I would be grateful!
I have added as much info as possible. It seems others have uploaded Byron data too.
The doorbell is just a single push button sending a single contact signal. 

Please do help add this to the database, Thank you very much. I really appriciate it.
