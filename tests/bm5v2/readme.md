# BM5 v2.0 12V Automotive Battery Monitor

<img src="ancel_bm200.jpg" alt="Ancel BM200" height="240">

Manufactured by Shenzhen Leagend Optoelectronics Co. Ltd.  Sold as "ANCEL BM200" on Amazon, and "QUICKLYNKS BM5-D" on AliExpress
(I can't find any 3rd party testing reports on this 433mhz model, but this company also produces a popular Bluetooth version called the 
BM6 among other names, with an FCC-ID of 2AU4A-191114)

The monitor consists of a sensor/transmitter that attaches to the 12v battery, and a solar powered display/receiver that sits on the dash.  The transmitter sends all relevant data, once every 1-2 seconds at 433.92 MHz.

## Signal and Message Format
The transmission is inverted from the normal "OOK_PULSE_PWM" decoder, with a "0" represented as a short pulse of 225us, and a 675us gap,
and a "1" represented as a long 675us pulse, and a 225us gap.

Each message consists of a preamble (long pulse, plus eight 50% symbol length pulses) sent at double the normal data rate, then a one byte pause (at regular data rate),
then ten bytes of payload plus a one byte checksum.  The preamble is decoded as (0x7F 0x80) by rtl_433 (in the native, non-inverted state) due to the initial pulse.

Payload:

- I = 3 byte ID
- S = 7 bits for battery State of Health (SOH) - 0 to 100 percent
- C = 1 bit flag for charging system error (!CHARGING on display --probably
triggered if running voltage below ~13v)
- s = 7 bits for battery State of Charge (SOC) 0 to 100 percent
- c = 1 bit flag for cranking system error. (!CRANKING indicator on display -
triggered if starting voltage drops for too long -- excessive cranking)
- T = 7 bits for sensor temperature magnitude (degrees C, converted if necessary
in display)
- t = 1 bit for temperature sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative)
- V = 16 bits, little endian for current battery voltage (Voltage is displayed
as a float with 2 significant digits.  The 16 bit int represents this voltage,
multiplied by 1600. -- note:  The display truncates the voltages to 2 decimal
points.  I've chosen to round instead of truncate, as this seems a better
representation of the true value.)
- v = 16 bits, little endian for previous low voltage during last start.  (Is
probably used for the algorithm to determine battery health.  This value will be
closer to resting voltage for healthy batteries) Same 1600 multiplier as above.
- R = 1 byte Checksum
