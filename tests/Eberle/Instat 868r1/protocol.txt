// the following is supposed by myself for organization of data

after Manchester decoding each data part have in total 26 bit, 2bit Header, 24 bit data in 6 nibbles
Nibbles for mode of sending clearly depends on parity of ID, in addition a parity nibble is used

(1) learn, 24bit in 6 nibbles
  xxx   x     x      x
  ||    ||    ||     ||
  ||    ||    ||     \/
  ||    ||    ||    check 0-F
  ||    ||    \/
  ||    ||    parity  ID odd: A
  ||    ||            ID even: 5
  ||    \/             
  ||    learn  ID odd: 3
  ||           ID even: C   
  \/             
 ID: 000-FFF, random number for each learning


(2) Reset#1, 24bit in 6 nibbles
  xxx   x     x      x
  ||    ||    ||     ||
  ||    ||    ||     \/
  ||    ||    ||    check 0-F
  ||    ||    \/
  ||    ||    Parit√§t ID odd: A
  ||    ||            ID even: 5
  ||    \/             
  ||    Reset ID odd: B
  ||          ID eben: 4
  \/             
 ID: 000-FFF, no change

(2) Reset#2-#9, 8 protocols are send in a sequence, eaach one 24 bit in 6 nibbles

  xxx   x     x      x
  ||    ||    ||     ||
  ||    ||    ||     \/
  ||    ||    ||    check 0-F
  ||    ||    \/
  ||    ||    on/off sequence, not fully analyzed yet, just work to do
  ||    ||           
  ||    \/             
  ||    on/off sequence, not fully analyzed yet, just work to do
  ||    sequence: off-on-off-on-off-on-off-off
  \/             
 ID: 000-FFF, no change


(3) switch on, 24 bit in 6 nibbles
  xxx   x     x      x
  ||    ||    ||     ||
  ||    ||    ||     \/
  ||    ||    ||    check 0-F
  ||    ||    \/
  ||    ||    rolling code ID odd (1 sender): C, 3, 8, 7, F, 0, A, 5, D, 2, 9, 6, E, 1, B, 4, C
  ||    ||                 ID even:
  ||    \/             
  ||    on ID odd: E
  ||       ID even: 1
  \/             
 ID: 000-FFF, no change

       
(3) switch off, 24 bit in 6 nibbles
  xxx   x     x      x
  ||    ||    ||     ||
  ||    ||    ||     \/
  ||    ||    ||    check 0-F
  ||    ||    \/
  ||    ||    rolling code ID odd (1 sender): F, 5, A, 2, D, 6, 9, 1, E, 4, B, 3, C, 7, 8, 0, F
  ||    ||                 ID even:
  ||    \/             
  ||    off ID odd: 5
  ||        ID even: A
  \/             
 ID: 000-FFF, no change


Lastly I was working on checksum, but found no solution so far. Simple Xor-Checksum works well for a part of data, but not all. Running data through revdgst-tools have not found a result by myself.
